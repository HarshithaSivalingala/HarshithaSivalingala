## 👨‍💻 What I Do

I build **real-time distributed systems**, **AI-powered applications**, and **intuitive UX experiences**. Currently a CS grad student at Iowa State University, working as a software developer and founding engineer.

### My Focus Areas

**🤖 AI/ML Development**
- Building **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems for context-aware applications
- **LLM integration** — Working with Claude API, OpenAI, and other models to solve real problems
- **AI code evaluation** — Understanding how LLMs generate code, testing reliability, and building validation pipelines
- Training and fine-tuning models with **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**
- Designing **prompt engineering strategies** and multi-stage AI workflows

**🔄 Real-Time Systems**
- **Distributed backends** handling high-throughput data streams with fault tolerance (Redis, Python workers, WebSockets)
- **React visualization dashboards** — Interfaces that expose system metrics, pipeline progress, and live AI model performance
- Building systems that scale from prototype to production

**🎨 UX-Driven Engineering**
- **Certified UX professional** translating complex AI systems into intuitive experiences
- Designing interfaces for AI tools that non-technical users can actually understand
- Making AI outputs explainable and actionable through thoughtful design

**What gets me excited:** Building AI applications that work in production. Understanding how LLMs think and fail. Creating systems where solid ML architecture meets clean frontend design. Making AI accessible through good UX.

## 🚀 AI/ML Projects

**Cross-Versioning Platform** — LLM-powered tool using **Claude API** to automate ML code migrations. Built RAG system analyzing deprecated TensorFlow/PyTorch APIs and generating modern equivalents. React dashboard with **multi-stage AI validation** — syntax parsing, architecture comparison, behavioral testing. Reduced manual refactoring by 80%.

**AI-Powered Test Automation Agent** — Built system using **OpenAI API** for automated test generation. Orchestrated multi-turn LLM conversations for code analysis, test case generation, and refinement. Achieved 80% code coverage with intelligent prompt engineering and validation loops.

**AI Code Evaluation Framework** — Researching how LLMs generate code and building evaluation pipelines. Testing reliability of AI-generated code through automated testing, static analysis, and behavioral verification. Understanding failure modes and improving prompt strategies.

---

## 💻 Full-Stack Projects

**Real-Time Genomic Pipeline** — Distributed system with React dashboards for live data visualization. Processing 50+ files simultaneously with fault-tolerant architecture.

**Production Management System** — Founding engineer architecting React + Node.js + PostgreSQL manufacturing system. Handling complex workflows with real-time tracking.

**Open-Source Issue Explorer** — Platform connecting contributors with 450+ repos through TypeScript UI and real-time GitHub integration using FastAPI.

---

## 💡 What Makes Me Different

I understand **how AI actually works** — not just how to call APIs. I've built RAG systems, evaluated LLM outputs, designed prompt strategies, and understand the architecture behind these models. Combined with my **UX certification** and **full-stack skills**, I can build AI applications that are not just functional, but actually usable and reliable.

I bridge three worlds: **AI/ML engineering**, **full-stack development**, and **UX design**. This means I can architect LLM pipelines, build production systems around them, AND create interfaces that make AI outputs understandable.
